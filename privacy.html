<body>
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 15 September 2025</p>

  <p>Vocaboo (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the Vocaboo mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous usage information (such as searches, page visits, or interactions) to improve the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Vocaboo does not require users to create accounts, so we do not collect personal details like names or passwords.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> Limited technical information (such as device type, operating system) may be collected for analytics and app optimization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To improve the app experience.</li>
    <li>To fix bugs and enhance performance.</li>
    <li>To understand how users interact with the app features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent users’ personal information to third parties. Limited analytics data may be shared with service providers (like app hosting) only to improve performance.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your information, but no system is 100% secure. Use of the app is at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>The app may link to external websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Vocaboo is suitable for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.</p>
